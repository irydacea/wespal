Wespal
======

![Main window screenshot](github/wespal-screenshot-main.png)

This is a small app which allows [Wesnoth][1] artists and content authors to easily preview graphics as they would be recolored by the game’s unit team coloring system, without needing to run or modify the game itself.

It provides a simple image preview functionality, as well as the option to save the results to disk for other purposes. A built-in visual palette and color range editor allows artists and coders to play around with the various possibilities offered by Wesnoth’s team coloring and generate WML code for use in add-ons.

Usage
-----

To start Wespal, just double click the `wespal` executable.

You’ll be presented with an empty main window where you can choose to open an image file. Once you have opened a file, you can preview the effects of various Wesnoth recoloring systems on it. You can also generate pre-recolored copies of the original image file.


Configuration
-------------

The Tools menu allows access to the color range and palette editors, which allow you to define your own color ranges and palette editors for use in Wespal. You can also choose to generate WML code for your custom palettes and ranges, and copy it to clipboard, or simply save it to a file.

Wespal’s configuration, including any created custom palettes and ranges, is stored in a platform-dependent location:

| Platform | Location                                                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Irydacea\Wespal` (in the Registry) |
| macOS    | `$HOME/Library/Preferences/me.irydacea.Wespal.plist`           |
| Linux    | `$HOME/.config/Irydacea/Wespal.conf`                           |
